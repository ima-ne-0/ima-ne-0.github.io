## 🚀 About Me  

✨ **Why I chose software engineering**  
I want to become a software engineer because of the **ability to make a tangible impact**.  
Software engineers have the opportunity to create products that improve people's daily lives on a large scale. From building tools that enhance communication, to streamlining business operations, or providing wider access to information — this capacity to create something with a positive, real-world effect is what motivates me to pursue this path.  

💡 **My Inspiration**  
I am deeply inspired by the goal of **improving people's daily lives** through technology.  

🎯 **My Vision**  
My vision is to **build software that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their background, ability, or technological literacy**. I believe technology should be a tool for **equalizing opportunities**.  

This means:  
- 🖥️ Designing **intuitive interfaces** for non-technical users  
- ♿ Ensuring **compatibility with assistive technologies** for people with disabilities  
- 🌍 Creating **platforms that serve underserved or overlooked communities**  

Ultimately, my goal is to **remove barriers** and ensure that the benefits of technology are **shared widely**.
